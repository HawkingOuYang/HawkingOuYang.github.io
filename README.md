Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and good things never die, they last, and they refresh.

Memory, too, is a good thing, whether happiness or sadness, they both are part of life.

Still remember the poem that we learn at high school ?

If by life you were deceived, 

Don't be wild, don't be dismal.

In the day of grief, be mild.

Merry day will come, believe.

Present is dejected here.

Heart is always living in tomorrow.

In a moment, passes sorrow.

That which passes will be dear.



As you have been doing for years. Go for it, to be better.

Yesterday is a history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift, that's why it is called the present.

Everything good will come.
